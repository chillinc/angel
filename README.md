angel
=====

Angel automates the installs, supervision, and upgrades of services. Key features include multi-version and multi-branch concurrent installs that allow for easy testing and roll-forward/roll-back; delta transmissions for quickly deploying upgrades with minimal memory pressure; and a broad set of scriptable tools for development and automation.

This code should be considered "alpha" quality. It is based on code in production, but as it's extracted out, will not necessarily be deployable in its current state.

This initial release is meant to provide a reference point for future work.
